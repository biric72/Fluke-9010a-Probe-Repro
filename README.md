  # Fluke-9010a-Probe-Repro-Package
 Fluke 9000A Probe Repro Project for the 9010A Microsystem Troubleshooter

New Project. Yes I know, this is getting out of hands…;)

However, it always bugged me not to have an original Fluke 9000A Probe for the 9010A. Since these have become virtually unobtainable, I decided to try my best to make a repro which is as close as possible to the original’s physical appearance and electrical layout.

So here we are:

- Gerber archive to order the PCB’s with your manufacturer of choice
- The KiCAD files of the board if you want to make any changes
- Freecad file of the probe’s case:
    - I tried to keep the the case as close as possible to the original, but also printable with a ‚normal‘ 3d printer (see manual) so internally it is a bit simplified.
    - not all sketches are fully constraint, I did not want to spent an unnecessary amount of time.
    - I printed the case with black PLA, the windows with clear/natural PLA and the cable guide with flexible TPU which worked quite well. 
- A build manual which includes a BOM and part numbers for DigiKey.

To complete the build you will need moderate SMD soldering and general tinkering skills as well as a bit of patience.

I will try to keep the file available for a couple of weeks at least. I cannot post them directly on the forum as the archive would be too large. Feel free to do whatever you like with them except selling.

Of course I cannot be responsible  for any damage you do to yourself or your fluke; however, I have built 2 probes and they seem to work flawlessly. Also I won’t be able to offer much support because of the usual ‚time is sparse‘- thing.

Have fun
